                                A small amount of tint is applied behind the ear for 3 minutes to check for any reaction. For brow lamination you keep the cream on for 24 hours before washing off.

                            <p>
                                A During the 1980s women were encouraged to shave off their eyebrows and draw them back on with pencil, in the 1990s–2000s we still lusted after a thinner eyebrow. This has left a generation of us with patchy brows with gaps we don’t seem to be able to grow back in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To solve this and to get a fuller brow the best thing to do is have a wax AND tint! The wax cleans up the soft, downy hair giving what brow you do have a cleaner, fuller appearance and the tint clings to every tiny hair – even the ones you think you can’t see – to build a fuller brow.
                            </p>

                                A Ideally hair needs to be between 0.5cm – 1cm for optimum results. The time will differ for everyone but if you’ve been shaving you'll need to wait at least two weeks before attempting to wax, sometimes much longer.

                        <h3>Q How long will the results last?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A Results can vary from person to person and will depend on what skin type you are, what products you use on your face and what environmental factors impact your regrowth. As well as taking into consideration hair growth time and the thickness of the hair. As a very general rule the below applies:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Brow tinting – Up to 4 weeks</li>
                                <li>Brow Waxing - Up to 4 weeks</li>
                                <li>Brow Lamination – Up to 6 weeks</li>
                                <li>Facial Waxing – Up to 6 weeks</li>
                                <li>Body waxing – Up to 6 weeks</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please remember that results can vary from person to person and a client with fair hair who has been waxing for years may only need 6-8 intimate waxes a year whereas a client with darker hair who has never waxed may find every 3 weeks better for their treatments.
                        </p>

                    <section class="list-group-item">
                        <h3>Q What should I do in between waxing?</h3>
                        <p>
                            A The best thing to do is to leave the regrowth alone! Sometimes when styling your brows I may leave a few hairs that look out of place but they are part of the bigger picture to building your perfect brow shape. If you have to tweeze a stray hair, try to leave the start, arch and end of the brow alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you find that you suffer with ingrown hairs following your first few intimate or body waxes use a gentle exfoliator on the area 2-3 times a week. Never attempt to ‘dig’ a hair out as this can cause infection and permanent scaring.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A Waxing is by far the most effective and quickest way to remove hair right from the root.
                            (use image here)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Threading can be unpredictable, sometimes snapping the hair and causing ingrown hairs or sometimes removing hair that was meant to still be there.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Tweezing is controllable but time consuming as each hair is pulled out individually.

                    <h4>1. Waxing doesn’t work for me.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your hair will grow back at different rates for the first few waxes. Especially if you’ve been shaving as you will have all the hairs on different growth cycles. Never judge on one leg wax before your holiday in 2016. For best results, have 2-3 waxes before your holiday to ensure maximum results and hair free time.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Body Waxing is too painful.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Everyone has different pain thresholds. I use a honey and argan oil wax for soft body hair such as legs and arms and a sensitive hot wax for stubborn hair such as intimate and underarms. Good technique shouldn’t hurt you and you should definitely never bruise from waxing.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. Hair comes back darker and thicker.</h4>
                    <p>
                        If this was true, the minute men started to recede they would begin to wax!
                        As all the hair comes through at once after a few weeks of hair free time you sometimes have the illusions of this myth. However over time, hair becomes softer and thinner.
