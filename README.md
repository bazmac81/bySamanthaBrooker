## UX Development <a name="uxdev"></a>
### Project Goals

This site is to support a beauty business, By Samantha Brooker, which operates in the Thurrock area of Essex. Sam runs a mobile beauty business and has mainly been relying on her Facebook page to drive business. The website will give her more control over the information available to customers and to allow them to contact her should they wish to employ her services.

After an initial consultation with Sam we have been able to identify the following possible features that she would like to have available and that customers would expect to see when visiting and using the site.

### User Goals
Users of this site will be visiting for a number of reasons byt the primary reasons will be:
- Find you what treatments and services Sam has to offers
- Find out the cost of the treatments and services Sam offers
- Book an appiontment for a treatment with Sam.

In a fully functioning web app, users would expect to be able to pay for their appointment online. Particularly as contactless and card paymetns rise in place of cash payemnts.

Below you will find more detailed user stories that help define the above goals and will be used in determing the feature set of the web site in this first release.

### User Stories
The users for this site will be women. As the site at this stage is a static site without functionality, all users will be classed as **site visitor**. For user stories to cater for future features we would introduce a **client** user. This would be a user that is registered with the site and is looking to interact in some way i.e. make or amend a booking.

- As a **site visitor**, I want to find a **list of services** so that I can **find the treatment I require**
- As a **site visitor**, I want to find the **prices for the treatments** available so I can **understand the cost of a treatment and any offers**
- As a **site visitor**, I want to find **contact details** so that I can **enquire about a treatment or a potential booking**
- As a **site visitor** I want to find **more about the business practice** so that I can **understand what makes this different from other businesses**
- As a **site visitor**, I want to find information on **how the business is going to manage with COVID** so I am confident **I can book safely**
- As a **site visitor** I  want to find **customer testimonials** to help understand **quality of service**
- As a **site visitor** I want to find links to the **business social media** and see other customers reactions and satisfaction to **verify quality of service**
- As a **site visitor** I want to find information on **why waxing would be better than other methods of hair removal** to understand **level of experience** of business
- As a **site visitor** I want to find information on the **locations that this business operates in** so that I can understand if **I can book a treatment**

### Site Owner Goals
The site owner has the following goals that they wish to achieve from this project:
- Show what the **business is about**
- Highlight the **uniqueness of business - Sam herself**. A customer will be seen by her **personally** each time.
- Linked with **Sam’s social media channels** to showcase customer / service quality & scope to build a **level of trust**
- Allow customers to **make contact with Sam** for general enquiries
- Allow customers to **make a booking**
- Be mobile friendly with a **responsive layout design** for a smooth desktop experience
- Be **clean and simple** in design and not be perceived as overloaded and cluttered with excessive content
- Allow customers to **make full or part payments** and track this for easy management of bookings and payments

### Design Choices
Sam has been using a logo on some of her social media channels since she setup her business. The thing she was keen to do was ensure it represents the personal touch that comes from her being a sole trader and the person that her customers will interact with.

Sam was happy for me to develop her logo further so I provided 3 options for her to choose from. 

I have created a design folder to hold the sample files relating to this project for reference. These design options can be found [here](design/designoptions.html) and include logo samples, font choices and colours, which are listed in a little more detail below.

#### Fonts 
In keeping with the logo font I wanted to provide fonts that felt a little crafted and not too modern or system generated. I found these pairings in Google Fonts and put them together in a collection for Sam to choose her preferred combination. The key was they were easy to read as well as suiting the them of the site.

#### Colours
Sam already had some simple colours in her logo,which are bronze to dusky pink gradient. I wanted to expand on these colours to add more interest to the site but still keep in mind the style and theme. These colours a muted and soft. Also when building the site contrast needs to be a factor and so these colour combinations should give the site personality while also allowing the content to be easily seen / read.

#### Icons
In addition to the fonts and colourway, there are a few icons to be used through the site. These are sourced from Font Awesome and will be used for Contact Me and social media links. 

The final choices Sam made can be found [here](design/designfinal.html)

### Site Map and Wireframes
To help ensure that the site contains all of the required information I have created simple wireframes as a framework, using the User Stories and Site Owner Goals to ensure that all of the required features for this release are present.

The site is made up of 5 pages, which are shown in the below sitemap:

![Sitemap](design/wireframe/sitemap.png)

All of the wireframes were created mobile first, with subsequent wireframes showing the view on a tablet and desktop.
Below is the wireframe for the Home page in mobile view.

![homepagemobileview](design/wireframe/homemobileview.png)

As the Contact Me section isn't a page but a modal, you can see how this will behave below. Each of the other pages and device views can be found using the links that follow:

![contactmemobileview](design/wireframe/contactmemobileview.png)

- Home page: [Tablet](design/wireframe/hometabletview.png) | [Desktop](design/wireframe/homedesktopview.png)
- Treatments page: [Mobile](design/wireframe/treatmentsmobileview.png) | [Tablet](design/wireframe/treatmentstabletview.png) | [Desktop](design/wireframe/treatmentsdesktopview.png)
- Why Wax page: [Mobile](design/wireframe/) | [Tablet](design/wireframe/) | [Desktop](design/wireframe/)
- COVID-19: [Mobile](design/wireframe/covidmobileview.png) | [Tablet](design/wireframe/covidtabletview.png) | [Desktop](design/wireframe/coviddesktopview.png)
- About: [Mobile](design/wireframe/aboutmobileview.png) | [Tablet](design/wireframe/abouttabletview.png) | [Desktop](design/wireframe/aboutdesktopview.png)
- Contact (modal): [Tablet](design/wireframe/contacttabletview.png) | [Desktop](design/wireframe/contactdesktopview.png)

### **Features & Future Releases**
Based on what Sam is looking to achieve and what customers would expect to achieve from visiting her site, a fully functional site should contain the following features to be relevant and fit the needs:

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>
### HTML and CSS check using WC3
   - All html and CSS files were validated using the W3C validation tools. This did highlight some errors and warnings in relation to the use of some tags and the nesting of tags:
      - Nesting and `ul` / `ol` in another `ul` / `ol` without sitting it within its own `li` tags - *fixed*
      - Nesting and `ul` / `ol` in a `p` tag causing an issue - *fixed*
      - `iframe` border element now redundant - *fixed*
      - `article` and `section` tags require header child - *fixed*  
   - Following the required ammendments, all files passed without errors or warnings
   - <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"><img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px" src="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue" alt="Valid CSS!" /></a>

### Peer Code Review
I posted my site on the Peer Code Review channel to gain feedback. This highlighted the follwing bugs which are detailed in the Bugs and De-bugging section.

### User testing
I shared the link for the site with various friends to get their feeback. There were a number of bugs highlighted as well as other feedback, including:
- The Face Treatments Table breaking out of it's container in smaller screens
- The md screen navbar appearing on small screens unintentionally
- That users trust testimonials and want to see more - these lead to a change in the home screen to show all customer feeback and remove the screen break formatting that hid some reviews on smaller screens
- Targeting of feature links on homepage linking through to same page section

## Bugs and De-bugging <a name="bugs"></a>

Below are the bugs identified through the various stages of testing and how they have been managed:

- Loading times slow due to image file size
   - **Issue:** The stock image default sizes were large and caused pages to load slowly.
   - **Fix:** I ran the images through an image compressor site to reduce to image size to less than 50% to improve this.
- Logo rendering causing flickering while applying the relevant Google Fonts
   - **Issue:** As the page loads the logo text loads in a default system font before applying the required Google Font
   - **Fix:** For consistency in loading and responsive design the logo was converted to an image.
- Target of links on homepage Face and Body waxing feature not targeting correct section of treatments page
   - **Issue:** The features on the homepage link through to relevant pages of the site. The first two features link to different sections of the same page. The face and body treamtments feature should have linked to the treatments-list anchor but instead linked to the news1 anchor which is for brow lamination.
   - **Fix:** Upated the link to target the correct id on the page
- Various typos and spelling corrections
   - **Issue:** As part of collating, entering and copying in content there were various typos and grammatical errors.
   - **Fix:** Re-reading each page and updating and correcting the relevant issues also highlighted from user testing.
- Mid screen drop down menu appearing on mobile screens
   - **Issue:** The dropdown introduced into the nav bar to prevent the menu items from crashing into each other also appeared in smaller mobile views as part of the toggle effect.
   - **Fix:** Adjusted the bootstrap breakpoint system so that the dropdown menu only appears at medium screen sizes.
- Nav toggle button wrapping on narrow screens
   - **Issue:** The nav menu has been built to appear on a sinlge line. At smaller screens the nav bar toggle button was wrapping onto a new line.
   - **Fix:** To facilitate the meny remaining on one line, the icon on the contact me button has been set to only display from sm screen sizes and above.
- Face treatments data table breaking outside of container
   - **Issue:** There are 2 tables on the treatments page and the face treatments table was breaking out of its container causing display issues on small screens.
   - **Fix:** Applied bootstrap width styling to the table to ensure that the table dislpayed as desired at all screen break points.
- Feature content overflowing container on some screen sizes
   - **Issue:** At certain screen sizes (xs and between md & lg) the content of the feature cards overflows out of the card crashing into the footer section.
   - **Fix:** At this time an overflow ccs style has been applied to prevent the content breaking out of its container.
- Broken contact me link on FAQ and Treatments pages
   - **Issue:** A place holder contact link was added to the FAQ head copy but not connected correctly to the contact me modal. 
   - **Fix:** Correctly styled the link and connected it to the contact me modal so behave consistently with all contact links across the site.
- Contact icon in footer jumping to top
   - **Issue:** When clicked, the screen will go to the top of the page before opening the modal due to a redundant `a` tag wrapping the icon content
   - **Fix:** Remove the redundant `a` tag from the icon acroos all pages
- Contact modal button not activating form
   - **Issue:** As the contact modal is built using a Bootstrap card the buttons in the footer are not connected to the form so do not active when pressed.
   - **Fix:** Give the form an `id` and add the `form` element to the send button to submit the form. Also inlude the `required` attribute to ensure all relevant details are captured.

### Known Issues
Below is a list of known bugs that are either not able to be resolved at this time due or are outside the scope of this project. They will be factored into the development of future releases to have them resolved.

- FAQ sections using Bootstrap Accordion focus issue
   - **Issue:** The FAQ section utilises the Bootstrap accordion utility to help manage screen space and prevent the content overloading the screen by having everything visibile at once. The issue is then clicking on the header of an FAQ the card expands but pushes the content up making the user scroll to get to the start of the content which is not desirable. 
   - **Fix:** Having searched for solutions, the fix appears to require Javascript code to help manage the transition as desired and so will be resolved at a later date.
